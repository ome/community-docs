The main goal of this repository is to provide installation guidelines 
of 3rd party tools so they can be used with OMERO. Submissions of other 
installation-related content e.g. guidelines in other languages are also welcome.

A template file describes the information that an installation file
should provide so it can be useful to the community.

This repository should be community-driven. 

**Please note:**
The aim of this repo is to host additional documentation written by the community 
for the community. The OME team will review content when it is submitted for basic 
accuracy where possible (we cannot do this for submissions not in English) but 
assume no responsibility for testing or maintaining the content going forward. You 
should not assume old content remains accurate for newer versions of OMERO or 
third-party tools. Use at your own risk and please consult the user community via the 
[forums](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/community/index.php) or 
[mailing lists](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/community/mailing-lists) if in doubt.
